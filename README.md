# Effect-On-Price-Houses-Linear-Regression.
This project applies multiple linear regression to the Ames Housing dataset to predict house prices. The final model uses four predictors: Year_Built, Gr_Liv_Area, TotRms_AbvGrd, and Lot_Area. Log transformations were applied to Sale_Price and Lot_Area to meet regression assumptions.
